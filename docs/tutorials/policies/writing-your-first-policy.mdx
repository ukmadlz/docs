# Writing Your First Policy

A CloudQuery policy is a directory, that contains a `policy.hcl` file at its root.

So, for your first policy, create a `my_first_policy` directory:

```bash
mkdir my_first_policy
```

And, in it, create a `policy.hcl` file:

```hcl title='my_first_policy/policy.hcl'
policy "my-first-policy" {
  title = "My First CloudQuery Policy"

  configuration {
    provider "aws" {
      version = ">= 0.10.0"
    }
  }

  check "old-stopped-ec2-instances" {
    title = "Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period"
    query = "SELECT account_id, region, id FROM aws_ec2_instances WHERE state_name = 'stopped' AND NOW() - state_transition_reason_time > INTERVAL '30' DAY"
    expect_output = false
  }
}
```

and run it with
```bash
cloudquery policy run ./my_first_policy
```

:::caution Important
Due to the fact that the `cloudquery policy run` also supports running policies from [our official github](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies),
to run policies from the local filesystem, you **must** specify a path beginning with `./` or `../` -
absolute pats will not work**
:::

Let's go over the structure of this `policy.hcl` file:
- At the root is the `policy` block, followed by its label.
- The `title` is a human readable description of the policy.
- The `configuration` block defines which CloudQuery providers are required to run this policy.
  For instance, if you are querying aws tables, you must have an `aws` provider block in your `configuration`.
  - The `version` field of the `provider` block is a string describing which version of the CloudQuery provider to use.
  - You can have multiple `providers` in this section, if your policy queries several different clouds.
- Next, the `check` block describes the "core" of the policy - which checks to run. 
  You can have as many `checks` here as you'd like, and they will all run when you run the policy.
  - each `check` block must have a name (before the open-curly-bracke).
  - `title` (mandatory, string): a human-readable description of the `check`.
  - `query` (mandatory, string): The SQL query to run.
     -  the `hcl` format doesn't support multi-line strings for double-quoted strings. For multiline strings, you 
        need to use the [heredoc](https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/strings#heredoc-strings) format. 
        For the above example, it would look like:
        ```hcl
        check "old-stopped-ec2-instances" {
        title = "Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period"
        query = <<ENDOFQUERY
          SELECT account_id, region, id
          FROM aws_ec2_instances
          WHERE state_name = 'stopped'
            AND NOW() - state_transition_reason_time >
            INTERVAL '30' DAY
          ENDOFQUERY
        expect_output = false
        }
        ```
  - `expect_output` (optional, boolean): each `check` in a policy returns a Pass/Fail result, according to whether the query
    returned any results. When `expect_output` is `false` (the default), the `check` expects the query results to be empty.
    When `expect_output` is `true`, the `check` expects the query results to contain at least one row.

## Manual Checks

By default, policy `check`s are Pass/Fail, depending on whether the query returns result or not
(and the value of `expect_output`). But sometimes you'd like to see all the results from the query (i.e. all rows)
rather than just an empty/non-empty indication. For this purpose, you can use the `manual` check type.

For instance, in the above example, if we wanted the policy to return all the results from our query, we would use

```hcl title="policy.hcl"
policy "my-first-policy" {
    ...
    ...
    check "old-stopped-ec2-instances" {
        type = "manual"
        title = "Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period"
        query = "SELECT account_id, region, id FROM aws_ec2_instances WHERE state_name = 'stopped' AND NOW() - state_transition_reason_time > INTERVAL '30' DAY"
    }
}
```

Running the policy with 

```bash
cloudquery policy run ./my_first_policy
```

Will now print the results of the query in tabular form, similar to:

```
📋 my-first-policy Results:

⚠️ Policy finished with warnings

        ⚠️  old-stopped-ec2-instances  Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period  manual
                  +--------------+-----------+---------------------+
                  |  account_id  |  region   |         id          |

                  +--------------+-----------+---------------------+
```

or, if results are outputted to a `.json` file (the `--output-dir` flag)

```json
{
  "PolicyName": "my-first-policy",
  "ExecutionTime": "2022-02-10T13:09:31.442841+02:00",
  "Passed": false,
  "Results": [
    {
      "name": "old-stopped-ec2-instances",
      "description": "Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period",
      "result_headers": [
        "account_id",
        "region",
        "id"
      ],
      "result_rows": [
        [
          "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
          "us-east-1",
          "i-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        ],
        [
          "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
          "us-east-1",
          "i-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        ]
      ],
      "type": "manual",
      "check_passed": false
    }
  ],
  "Error": "",
  "LoadedPolicies": null
}
```

- The `type` field must be either `"manual"` or `"automatic"` (`"automatic"` by default).
  - `"automatic"` means that the check will return a PASS/FAIL result, according to `expect_output`
  - `"manual"` means that the check will print a table with the results of the query, rather than a PASS/FAIL indication.

A policy can have any combination of `"automatic"` and `"manual"` checks.

## Referencing a Query in a Separate File

Up to now, we inlined our SQL queries in the `policy.hcl` file. CloudQuery also provides the option to
instead reference an SQL file that contains the file with the `file()` directive. 
For our `my_first_policy` example, we can use this in the following way:

```hcl title="my_first_policy/policy.hcl"
policy "my-first-policy" {
  title = "My First CloudQuery Policy"

  configuration {
    provider "aws" {
      version = ">= 0.10.0"
    }
  }

  check "old-stopped-ec2-instances" {
    title = "Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period"
    query = file("./old_stopped_ec2_instances.sql")
    expect_output = false
  }
}
```

And an additional `old_stopped_ec2_instances.sql` file:

```sql title="my_first_policy/old_stopped_ec2_instances.sql"
SELECT account_id, region, id 
    FROM aws_ec2_instances 
    WHERE state_name = 'stopped' 
        AND NOW() - state_transition_reason_time > INTERVAL '30' DAY
```

:::tip
It is recommended to use relative paths ("./some-path", "../some-path", etc.) to reference files for queries.
Using absolute-paths tends to couple the path to your specific machine, and cause errors down the road.
