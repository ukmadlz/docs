# Policies Overview

## Prerequisites

This tutorial uses examples from an AWS deployment. To start, follow our 
[Getting Started with AWS](https://docs.cloudquery.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-aws) guide
to install cloudquery, authenticate with AWS, and `fetch` your cloud deployment into a PostgreSQL database.
If you are using a different cloud provider, you can see our 
[Getting Started with GCP](https://docs.cloudquery.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-gcp) and 
[Getting Started with Azure](https://docs.cloudquery.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-azure) guides, 
and try to follow along.

## Overview

CloudQuery allows you to use SQL to check various conditions about your cloud depoyment. 
For instance, the following SQL query allows you to test whether you have any AWS EC2 instances that were stopped
more than 30 days ago, but were not deleted.

```SQL
SELECT account_id, region, id
FROM aws_ec2_instances
WHERE state_name = 'stopped'
      AND NOW() - state_transition_reason_time >
      INTERVAL '30' DAY
```

CloudQuery Policies allow you to run prewritten queries (and sets of queries) with `cloudquery policy run`.

The CloudQuery team and community already implemented many different policies for many different providers.
Among them are the [AWS CIS Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services), 
the [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/), and 
the [AWS Foundational Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp.html).

You can find the full list of existing policies on

- [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io/) ([AWS](https://hub.cloudquery.io/policies/cloudquery/aws/latest/policies),
[GCP](https://hub.cloudquery.io/policies/cloudquery/gcp/latest/policies), [Azure](https://hub.cloudquery.io/policies/cloudquery/azure/latest/policies))
- [Our GitHub](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies) ([AWS](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws), 
[GCP](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies/gcp), [Azure](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies/azure))

- Or, from the command line, with :
  ```bash
  cloudquery policy describe aws # you can replace `aws` with `gcp`, `azure`, or another provider.
  ```

For instance, you can run the previous query (that is taken from our 
[AWS Foundational Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp.html) 
policy) with 

```bash
cloudquery policy run aws//foundational_security/ec2/EC2.4
```

that will return a pass/fail result, and, if the check failed, the `id`s of the offending resources.

```text title="policy run result examples"
📋 aws Results:

⚠️ Policy finished with warnings

        ❌  EC2.4  Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period  failed
                ❌  i-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

You can get a `.json` report instead if you use the `--output-dir` flag:

```bash
cloudquery policy run aws//foundational_security/ec2/EC2.4 --output-dir /path/to/output_dir
```

which will create a `.json` file at the `output_dir` directory, that will look like:

```json
{
  "PolicyName": "aws",
  "ExecutionTime": "2022-02-10T11:21:57.256407+02:00",
  "Passed": false,
  "Results": [
    {
      "name": "EC2.4",
      "description": "Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period",
      "result_headers": [
        "account_id",
        "region",
        "id"
      ],
      "result_rows": [
        [
          "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
          "us-east-1",
          "i-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
        ]
      ],
      "type": "automatic",
      "check_passed": false
    }
  ],
  "Error": "",
  "LoadedPolicies": null
}
```

You can also run the entire Foundational Security policy with:

```bash
cloudquery policy run aws//foundational_security
```

or just the EC2 section with:
```bash
cloudquery policy run aws//foundational_security/ec2
```

:::info
Cloudquery Policies are consisted of SQL queries that are executed against the PostgreSQL database configured in
your `config.hcl` file. This means that before running policies, you must run `cloudquery fetch` to populate this
database with information from your cloud.
