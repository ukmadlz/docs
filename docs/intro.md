# Welcome to CloudQuery

CloudQuery extracts the configuration and metadata of your infrastructure and transforms it into a relational SQL database. This allows you to write SQL queries for easy monitoring, governance, and security. 

## Key Features

### Explore and Monitor with SQL

CloudQuery extracts, transforms (normalize), and loads (ETL) the data from scattered APIs across different cloud and SaaS providers into the PostgreSQL relational database. This gives you the ability to work with SQL to focus on your business logic without writing code and working directly with APIs.

### Security and Compliance as Code

You can write your security and compliance rules using SQL as the query language and HCL as the engine. Just like you use IaC to build, change, and version your infrastructure, you can use CloudQuery Policies to monitor, alert, and version your cloud infrastructure security and compliance rules.

### Extensible

CloudQuery is an open-source and extensible framework. All official and approved community providers and policies are listed in [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io). See [Developing New Provider](./developers/developing-new-provider.md).
